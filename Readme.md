# ChatGPT Exercise: build a menu-based text game in python wiht ChatGPT

The second-level headings are my prompts, or questions. to ChatGPT. The contents of each of those headings are the ansewers received from ChatGPT. I created the files it asked for in VS code. 

## 1. Code a basic framework for a menu-driven text-based game.

Sure! Below is a basic framework for a menu-driven text-based game in Python. This framework includes a simple game loop, a main menu, and placeholders for different game options.

(See pygame.py)

Explanation:

    Game Class: The main class that handles the game logic.
    Main Menu: Displays the options and handles user input.
    Start Game: Initializes a new game and enters the game loop.
    Load Game: Placeholder for loading a saved game.
    Options: Placeholder for game options; can be expanded later.
    Exit Game: Exits the game loop and ends the program.
    Game Loop: Contains the main actions the player can take in the game.

You can build upon this framework by adding more features, story elements, and game mechanics as you go along!

## 2. Improve your last answer by abstracting the code so that it loads the menus and text from a configuration file.

Certainly! By abstracting the menus and text into a configuration file, we can make the game more flexible and easier to modify. Below is an improved version of the previous code that loads menu options and text from a JSON configuration file.

### Step 1: Create a Configuration File

Create a file named game_config.json with the following content:

(see config.json)

### Step 2: Update the Game Code

Now, modify the Python game code to read from this configuration file:

(see updated pygame.py)

Explanation:

    Configuration File: The game_config.json file stores all the text and menu options.
    Load Configuration: The load_config method reads the JSON file and stores the configuration.
    Display Menu: The display_menu method is used to print any menu based on the configuration.
    Main Menu, Game Loop, Options: These methods use the configuration data to present the appropriate text and options.

Benefits:

    Flexibility: You can easily change the game's text and options by editing the JSON file without altering the code.
    Separation of Concerns: Keeps game logic separate from the presentation layer, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

You can expand this framework further by adding more complex game logic and additional menus as needed!

## 3. Add a couple more rooms to the game

Sure! Let's expand the game by adding a couple more rooms. Each room will have its own description and actions the player can take. We’ll modify the code to handle multiple rooms and allow the player to navigate between them.
Updated Configuration File

First, update the game_config.json file to include the new rooms:

(see updated game_config.json)

Next, update the Python game code to handle room navigation:

(see uupdated pygame.py)

Sure! Let's expand the game by adding a couple more rooms. Each room will have its own description and actions the player can take. We’ll modify the code to handle multiple rooms and allow the player to navigate between them.

### Updated Configuration File

First, update the game_config.json file to include the new rooms:

(see updated game_config.json)

### Updated Game Code

Next, update the Python game code to handle room navigation:

#### Explanation of Changes:

    Room Configuration: The game_config.json now includes a rooms section with descriptions and options for each room.
    Current Room Tracking: The game tracks the player's current room with the self.current_room variable.
    Dynamic Room Navigation: When the player chooses an option that leads to a new room, the game updates the current room and displays the new room's description and options.
    Game Loop: The game loop now checks the current room's options and allows navigation based on the player's input.

#### Game Flow:

    Start in "room1" (the dark room).
    From "room1", you can open the door to "room2" (the bright hallway).
    From "room2", you can go back to "room1" or enter "room3" (the library).
    In "room3", you can return to "room2".

Feel free to add more rooms, options, and interactions to expand the game further!
