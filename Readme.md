## 1. Code a basic framework for a menu-driven text-based game.

Sure! Below is a basic framework for a menu-driven text-based game in Python. This framework includes a simple game loop, a main menu, and placeholders for different game options.

(See pygame.py)

Explanation:

    Game Class: The main class that handles the game logic.
    Main Menu: Displays the options and handles user input.
    Start Game: Initializes a new game and enters the game loop.
    Load Game: Placeholder for loading a saved game.
    Options: Placeholder for game options; can be expanded later.
    Exit Game: Exits the game loop and ends the program.
    Game Loop: Contains the main actions the player can take in the game.

You can build upon this framework by adding more features, story elements, and game mechanics as you go along!

## 2. Improve your last answer by abstracting the code so that it loads the menus and text from a configuration file.

Certainly! By abstracting the menus and text into a configuration file, we can make the game more flexible and easier to modify. Below is an improved version of the previous code that loads menu options and text from a JSON configuration file.

### Step 1: Create a Configuration File

Create a file named game_config.json with the following content:

(see config.json)

### Step 2: Update the Game Code

Now, modify the Python game code to read from this configuration file:

(see updated pygame.py)

Explanation:

    Configuration File: The game_config.json file stores all the text and menu options.
    Load Configuration: The load_config method reads the JSON file and stores the configuration.
    Display Menu: The display_menu method is used to print any menu based on the configuration.
    Main Menu, Game Loop, Options: These methods use the configuration data to present the appropriate text and options.

Benefits:

    Flexibility: You can easily change the game's text and options by editing the JSON file without altering the code.
    Separation of Concerns: Keeps game logic separate from the presentation layer, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

You can expand this framework further by adding more complex game logic and additional menus as needed!
