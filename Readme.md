## 1. Code a basic framework for a menu-driven text-based game.

Sure! Below is a basic framework for a menu-driven text-based game in Python. This framework includes a simple game loop, a main menu, and placeholders for different game options.

(See pygame.py)

Explanation:

    Game Class: The main class that handles the game logic.
    Main Menu: Displays the options and handles user input.
    Start Game: Initializes a new game and enters the game loop.
    Load Game: Placeholder for loading a saved game.
    Options: Placeholder for game options; can be expanded later.
    Exit Game: Exits the game loop and ends the program.
    Game Loop: Contains the main actions the player can take in the game.

You can build upon this framework by adding more features, story elements, and game mechanics as you go along!
